## **_Hello there!_**

I'm just another fresher stepping into the world of software development and coding 💻✨
Exploring bugs, breaking stuff (sometimes on purpose 😅), and building things one line at a time!

🌱 Currently learning: Python, Git, and how not to panic when things break 😬

🔧 Tinkering with: VS Code, FastAPI, and CLI magic

🚀 Dreaming of deploying cool stuff that actually works

💡 Motto: “Consistency, consistency, consistency!” 😄

Let’s connect, build, and maybe cry over broken builds together 👨‍💻☕
